      <h2>Put simply, helping our tenants succeed helps us succeed. We provide quality spaces for our tenants to grow
        and succeed
        and for their people to call home. Working in partnership with you, we’ll deliver what you need today and
        tomorrow.</h2>

        <h3>Tenancy Philosophy</h3>
        <p>We appreciate that our buildings provide an environment for companies to grow and succeed. They are spaces
          for people to
          work, develop and belong. Expect us to work with you to make sure our building provides the facilities you
          need today
          and as you develop your business into the future.</p>

        <p>We do everything we can to make it easy for you to work with us. We will assign a dedicated person to be your
          primary
          point of contact – someone who will get to know your business and your specific needs. We will provide
          communication
          that is clear, timely and relevant. And you’ll find us very responsive. We will deal with any issues quickly
          and
          appropriately to make sure they don’t become big problems for you or for us.</p>
        <h3>Tenancy Communications</h3>
        <p>We pride ourselves on our communication with our tenants. Each property has a dedicated asset manager and
          property
          manager allowing our tenants to have a direct line of communication with us. We attempt to address all tenancy
          issues
          promptly in order to ensure the building environment is safe and conducive to comfortable occupation. We also
          have an
          after hours help desk that allows us to respond to any issues should they come up outside of our normal office
          hours.</p>
        <p>Twice a year we send our tenant newsletter to keep our tenant family updated on what's happening within the
          portfolio as
          well as other areas of interest. We periodically survey our tenants allowing us to address any concerns as
          they become
          apparent.</p>
        <p>We also work very closely with our tenants on all issues relating to health and safety. We actively encourage
          our
          tenants to strive to achieve excellence in their own health and safety performance as we do at Argosy.</p>
        <h3>Tenancy Diversity</h3>
        <p>Every one of our tenants is important to us. We are proud to have a highly diversified portfolio of 177
          tenants. Our
          list of tenants includes Government departments, large listed and unlisted businesses, owner occupiers and
          large and
          small retailers. This variety of tenants provides the portfolio with well diversified income streams, with the
          largest
          tenant in the portfolio being Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment with approximately 11% of gross
          property
          rental income. This tenant diversification assists us in our goal of providing reliable and sustainable
          returns to our
          shareholders.</p>
