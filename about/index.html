      <h2>It’s the combination of acquiring, developing and managing a diversified portfolio of quality properties and

        <p>An argosy is a flotilla of ships. It’s strength arises from the sum of its parts. And that’s why it’s an apt
          name for us
          as well.</p>
        <p>Our strength comes from a balanced approach across our stakeholders and our properties.</p>
        <p>We believe in doing the right thing and doing things right. Treating our shareholders, tenants, employees and
          supply
          partners equally well lays the foundations for a strong company.</p>
        <p>As one of New Zealand’s leading listed property companies, we own a diversified portfolio of industrial,
          office and
          retail properties predominately in Auckland and Wellington, with a modest tenant-driven exposure to other
          parts of New
          Zealand.</p>
        <p>Our tenants span a wide variety of industries. Each one has unique spacial requirements but whatever they
          need, we
          always focus on delivering safe and workable environments that allow their businesses to prosper.</p>
        <p>We are listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange under the ticker code ARG. With more than 9,000 shareholders,
          it’s their
          money and on-going support allows us to keep getting stronger.</p>
